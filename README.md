# TCP-Chat-Room

I followed a video tutorial demonstrating the basics of Java sockets. It was my first time working with Java sockets and I learned how to 
create client and server interactions through TCP ports. 

The tutorial helped me get a grasp of a new concept and it gave me ideas of what to add in the future. I want to revisit this code and add
a GUI so that the chat server doesn't rely on the command line for interactions between clients.
